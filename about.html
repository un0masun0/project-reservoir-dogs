                      Elena began her culinary career at the age of 19, learning and working her way up from dishwasher at Hank's Huntington Inn in Monroe, CT. While attending the Center for Cooking, she learned and worked in every single position at the Huntington Inn. She then worked at Kitty and Logan's under Chef Scott Summers, and landed in NYC at BRAND. She began at BRAND 4 years ago as garde manger, and worked her way up to sous chef, and one year ago was named Chef de Cuisine under Erika.

                        Rosaura has always had a love of hospitality. As the oldest of three children, she cooked a good portion of the family dinners from a young age, under her mother's watchful eye.
                      After attending college at Massachusetts University, she moved to New York in 2005, and immediately fell into a job at Blue River Grill of NYPL Guest Hospitality Group. She was soon hired at BRAND as a bartender. This role played a huge part in her beverage education, and really opened her eyes to the world of wine. She moved up the ranks to manager, then service director and bar manager, and finally to general manager and wine director, her current role at BRAND.
